\description{
Function to take a directory of EV files and reset the path.
This works for EV files that have just an EK80 fileset, or that have the EK60 file set
as the first fileset, and the EK80 as the second fileset.
May want to eventually convert to calling "fileset1" and "fileset2" instead of EK60 and EK80.
Written by RT 2022.
Requires an excel file input that says what the paths are
Each row is a survey (survey_name), and each column is a path or file name
